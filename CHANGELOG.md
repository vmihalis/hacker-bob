# Changelog

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-25

- Fixed duplicate slash entries (`/bob-hunt` + `/bob:hunt`, etc.) in the Claude Code menu by giving the three skills colon-form `name:` frontmatter (`bob:hunt`, `bob:status`, `bob:debug`) so each skill IS its own slash command.
- Removed redundant command shims `commands/bob/{hunt,status,debug}.md`; only `commands/bob/update.md` remains because no skill backs `/bob:update`.
- Installer and `dev-sync.sh` now proactively delete the legacy hunt/status/debug shims on upgrade so users coming from <=1.1.0 do not retain orphan files that would re-introduce the duplicates.
- Uninstall manifest sweeps both the current shim layout and the legacy three-shim layout so old installs still clean up entirely.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-26

- Added `hacker-bob doctor <project-dir> [--json]` for read-only install diagnostics.
- Added `hacker-bob uninstall <project-dir> [--dry-run] [--yes] [--json]` for conservative removal of Bob-managed files and config entries.
- Added the `hacker-bob` npm alias package while keeping `hacker-bob-cc` canonical.
- Updated release publishing to publish both npm packages with provenance.
- Added Quickstart, troubleshooting docs, release notes, and bug report diagnostics guidance.
- Optimized the README image to reduce npm package size.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-26

- Clarified install docs and CLI help: Bob installs into one project directory per command, while global npm install only installs the `hacker-bob` CLI.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-26

- Initial public `hacker-bob-cc` npm package with `hacker-bob` CLI install and update commands.
- Added `/bob:update`, passive update cache checks, installed version metadata, and status update hints.
- Preserved the source `install.sh` path as a compatibility wrapper.
