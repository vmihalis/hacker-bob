# Changelog

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-26

- Added `hacker-bob doctor <project-dir> [--json]` for read-only install diagnostics.
- Added `hacker-bob uninstall <project-dir> [--dry-run] [--yes] [--json]` for conservative removal of Bob-managed files and config entries.
- Added host adapter selection with `--adapter claude|codex|generic-mcp|all`.
- Made `hacker-bob` the canonical npm package and kept `hacker-bob-cc` as a compatibility wrapper.
- Updated release publishing to publish both npm packages with provenance.
- Added Quickstart, troubleshooting docs, release notes, and bug report diagnostics guidance.
- Optimized the README image to reduce npm package size.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-26

- Clarified install docs and CLI help: Bob installs into one project directory per command, while global npm install only installs the `hacker-bob` CLI.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-26

- Initial public `hacker-bob-cc` npm package with `hacker-bob` CLI install and update commands.
- Added `/bob:update`, passive update cache checks, installed version metadata, and status update hints.
- Preserved the source `install.sh` path as a compatibility wrapper.
